## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 20+
- PostgreSQL database (automatically provisioned on Replit)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   The following are automatically configured on Replit:
   - `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection string
   - `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption key

3. **Initialize database**:

   npm run db:push
   ```
   This creates all tables and seeds 20 sample products.

4. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   The app runs on `http://localhost:5000`

## üì± User Guide

### Scanning a Bill

1. **Navigate to Scan Page**: Click "Scan Bill" in the navigation

## üî¨ Technical Deep Dive

### OCR Pipeline

1. **Image Preprocessing** (Sharp):
   - Convert to grayscale
   - Normalize brightness/contrast
   - Sharpen edges
   - Reduce noise

2. **Text Extraction** (Tesseract.js):
   - OCR with English language model
   - Extract raw text from preprocessed image

3. **Line Item Parsing**:
   - Regex patterns for prices (`$X.XX`)
   - Quantity detection (`2x`, `3 x`)
   - Product name extraction
   - Filter out headers/footers (total, tax, etc.)

4. **Bill Number Extraction**:
   - Pattern matching for receipt/invoice/order numbers
   - Multiple regex patterns for different receipt formats

### Product Matching Algorithm

Simple but effective similarity scoring:

```typescript
function calculateSimilarity(productName: string, dbProduct: Product) {
  // Exact match: 1.0
  // Substring match: 0.8
  // Word-by-word matching: 0.0 - 1.0
  // Threshold: 0.5 (50% confidence required)
}
```

**Future Improvements**:
- Levenshtein distance for typo tolerance
- Machine learning model for better matching
- User feedback loop to improve accuracy

### Duplicate Detection

**Method**: SHA-256 hash of image file
**Storage**: `billHash` column in bills table
**Check**: Before processing, query existing bills by hash

**Trade-off**: Hash-based detection prevents identical image uploads but won't catch:
- Same bill photographed from different angles
- Same bill with different lighting/quality

**Alternative Approaches**:
- Perceptual hashing (pHash) - more robust to minor changes
- Bill number extraction + date matching
- Combination of multiple signals

## üé® Design System

### Color Palette

**Green-Focused Sustainability Theme**:
- Primary: `hsl(142 76% 36%)` - Eco green
- Accent: `hsl(142 15% 88%)` - Light green
- Muted: `hsl(142 8% 90%)` - Subtle green tint

### Sustainability Score Badges

- **80-100**: Excellent (Dark Green)
- **60-79**: Good (Medium Green)
- **40-59**: Fair (Yellow)
- **0-39**: Poor (Orange)

### Typography

- **Primary**: Inter - Clean, legible
- **Accent**: Poppins - Bold numbers and points display

## ‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs & Decisions

### Client-Side vs Server-Side OCR

**Chosen**: Server-side (Tesseract.js on backend)

**Pros**:
- More processing power available
- Better image preprocessing capabilities
- Centralized error handling
- Easier to upgrade OCR engine

**Cons**:
- Network latency for image upload
- Server resource usage
- Scaling challenges with concurrent requests

**Alternative**: Cloud OCR services (Google Vision, AWS Textract)
- Higher accuracy but ongoing costs
- Rate limits and API dependencies
- Privacy concerns with third-party processing

### Product Matching: Exact vs Fuzzy

**Chosen**: Simple similarity scoring with 50% threshold

**Pros**:
- Fast and deterministic
- No external dependencies
- Easy to understand and debug

**Cons**:
- Limited accuracy with typos
- Struggles with abbreviations
- No learning/improvement over time

**Future**: Machine learning model trained on user feedback

### Database Schema: Normalized vs Denormalized

**Chosen**: Fully normalized schema with separate tables

**Pros**:
- Data integrity and consistency
- Flexible querying capabilities
- Easy to update product information
- Clear separation of concerns

**Cons**:
- More complex queries (joins required)
- Slightly higher latency
- More tables to manage

**Trade-off Accepted**: Performance is acceptable for this use case, and data integrity is more valuable.

### Image Storage: Local vs Cloud

**Chosen**: Local filesystem (development)

**Production Recommendation**: Cloud storage (S3, Cloudinary, etc.)

**Current Approach**:
- Images saved to `/uploads` directory
- Served via Express static middleware
- Image paths stored in database

**For Production**:
- Upload to S3/Cloud Storage
- Store public URL in database
- Implement cleanup policies
- CDN for faster delivery

## üß™ Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Upload bill image successfully
- [ ] OCR processing completes without errors
- [ ] Line items extracted accurately
- [ ] Products matched to sustainability database
- [ ] Points calculated correctly
- [ ] Duplicate bill rejection works
- [ ] Admin can create/edit/delete products
- [ ] Dashboard shows accurate statistics
- [ ] Dark mode toggle works

### Sample Test Data

20 pre-seeded products across categories:
- **Produce**: Organic bananas, spinach
- **Dairy**: Almond milk, eggs, yogurt
- **Grains**: Quinoa, rice, pasta
- **Snacks**: Dark chocolate, chips
- **Beverages**: Orange juice, soda

## üì¶ Deployment (Replit)

### Automatic Deployment

1. **Database**: Automatically provisioned PostgreSQL
2. **Environment**: All secrets pre-configured
3. **Build**: Automatic on push to main
4. **Domain**: `.replit.app` subdomain provided

### Manual Steps

1. Ensure `Start application` workflow is running
2. Database migrations run automatically on startup
3. Sample products seeded on first run
4. Application available at provided Replit URL

### Environment Variables

All managed automatically by Replit:
- `DATABASE_URL` - PostgreSQL connection
- `PGHOST`, `PGUSER`, `PGPASSWORD`, `PGDATABASE`, `PGPORT`
- `SESSION_SECRET` - Session encryption

### Scaling Considerations

**Current Setup**: Single-server deployment

**For High Traffic**:
- Separate OCR processing to background workers
- Queue system (Bull, BullMQ) for async processing
- Redis for caching product matches
- CDN for static assets
- Database read replicas
- Horizontal scaling with load balancer

## üêõ Known Limitations

1. **OCR Accuracy**: Tesseract.js ~80-90% accurate, depends on image quality
2. **Product Matching**: Simple algorithm, may miss variations
3. **Single User**: Demo mode with one user (easily extended to multi-user)
4. **Image Storage**: Local filesystem (not suitable for production)
5. **No Barcode Scanning**: Would significantly improve product matching
